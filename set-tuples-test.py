#set and tuple test

#this is a set - note the use of squiggly brackets
aSet = {2, 3, "Popeye", "Alice in Wonderland"}

#sets ignore duplicates
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}

#this is a tuple (not the use of parens)
aTuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "apple")

#tuples are ordered but immutable - you can't add or remove from them.
